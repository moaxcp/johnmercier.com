I just had this great idea to use github.com's editor for creating posts in this blog. Here is how it works.

. go to the repo moaxcp.github.io/_posts and click on the + to add a file
. create a file name and fill in the post
. commit to new branch for drafts or master if the post is good
. accept the pull request to publish the draft

I've been using vi and git on my laptop to write posts but I would much rather just use my broswer. The problem with the github editor is no spell checking but I have the same problem with my current vi setup. 

I'm sure this is known to many github users but it has taken me a while to put this idea together.

This is the first post I am doing this with so lets see how it goes.
