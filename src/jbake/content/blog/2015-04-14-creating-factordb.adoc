I started creating a new app called https://github.com/moaxcp/factordb[factordb]. I am using the new grails 3.0.1. I
have a few ideas for what it should do

* add new numbers and their factors
* this will be validated by multiplying the two numbers (no authentication needed)
* web service to add new numbers
* add prime numbers
* These are numbers that cannot be factored
* These will be submitted as requests, added once processed
* maintain a list of numbers to factor
* maintain factoring program which distributes jobs
* start, stop, send numbers to factor
* display stats for factoring program

These are just some ideas for now. The factoring program will be a separate project based off of
https://github.com/moaxcp/umuc-team-factor[umuc-team-factor].
