I finally changed my terminal to get rid of long paths. Right now it is

----
john@john-gentoo ~/Dropbox/programming/groovy/factordb/grails-app/conf $

----

And after the change it is

----
john@john-gentoo conf $

----

This is what I added to my .bashrc

----
PS1="\[33[01;32m\]\u\[33[01;34m\] \W \$\[33[00m\]"
