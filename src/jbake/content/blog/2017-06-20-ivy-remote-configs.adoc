I found an issue in an ivy.xml that resulted in hamcrest not being added to the test configuration. The junit
dependency looked like this:

----
<dependency org="junit" name="junit" rev="4.12" conf="test->master"/>
----

The problem is `test-&gt;master` means only get the main artifacts from the remote dependency (no transitives). The
fix is to change `test-&gt;master` to `test-&gt;default`. `master` and `default` are the only two values available for a
maven repository.
