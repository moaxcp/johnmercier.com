The new version of jbake did not run on nixos. These are my notes on fixing the issue.

The script which runs jbake switched from using the java command available on $PATH to calling java 
from $JAVA_HOME/bin/java. This is fixed by removing the call to substituteInPlace and adding 
wrapProgram.

----
     installPhase = ''
￼ -    substituteInPlace bin/jbake --replace "java" "${jre}/bin/java" 
￼      mkdir -p $out
￼      cp -vr * $out
￼ +    wrapProgram $out/bin/jbake --set JAVA_HOME "${jre}"
￼    '';
